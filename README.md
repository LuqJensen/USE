## Introduction

USE - Unified Shopping Experience is an offline webshop prototype based mostly in java.

The project is our complete prototype solution to our project case "Electroshoppens Cross-Channel satsning".


## Requirements

+ Platform: Linux, Windows, Mac(IS NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED) or Oracle Solaris
+ Java SE Development Kit ≥ 8.0.310.13
+ Java Runtime ≥ 8.0.310
+ PostgreSQL ≥ 9.4
+ JavaFX Scene Builder ≥ 2.0
+ JUnit ≥ 4.10

NOTE: Mac IS NOT currently supported, because the software simply does'nt work on Mac. 
We suspect this is due to a bug within Java Runtime 8.0.x
Specifically with either JFrames or Lambdas.
We have not tried to reproduce this bug on other Java versions, due to time limitations.
